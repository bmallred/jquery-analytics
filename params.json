For those of us who can not use Google Analytics at work or just want to dork with something else.\r\n\r\nHow to get it?\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/bmallred/jquery-analytics\r\n```\r\n\r\nEasy to use\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nWith just a few lines of code you can easily configure your own web page analytics. Just specify the URI you would like to communicate with\r\nand everything is a go. \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$(function () {\r\n\t$(\".trace\").analytics({\r\n\t\turl: \"http://localhost/trace\"\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nCustom tags supported out-of-the-box\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOften you want to track more meaningful information along with what is provided. Simply apply any number of custom attributes prefixed with **\"data-analytics-\"** and we will take care of the rest!\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a id=\"myLink\" href=\"#\" data-analytics-outfit=\"pajamas\" data-analytics-shoes=\"slippers\">My link</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will send the following information back:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\tid: \"myLink\",\r\n\toutfit: \"pajamas\",\r\n\tshoes: \"slippers\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDetermining the flow\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to track the flow a user goes through while visiting your page if you have an uniquely identifier piece of information. This can be done during initialization as such:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$(function () {\r\n\t$(\".trace\").analytics({\r\n\t\turl: \"http://localhost/trace\",\r\n\t\tclient: \"unique identifier\"\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nOriginally created by @bmallred.\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nIssues, questions, or comments?
